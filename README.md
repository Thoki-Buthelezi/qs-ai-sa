# AI Quantity Surveyor – South Africa

Turns any South African building drawings (PDF) into a full, categorised Bill of Quantities in under 2 minutes.

Built for real tenders. Works with SANS 1200. Handles 100-page PDFs without exploding costs.

## Features
- Page-by-page processing + smart-skip (title pages, notes → automatically ignored)
- Extracts: description, unit, quantity, notes
- Auto-categories: Structural | Architectural | Roofing | MEP | Finishes
- Upload your own price CSV → instant costing
- Fallback demo rates (clearly marked)
- Excel + CSV export
- Full raw AI output view for debugging

## Why this actually works
Other tools send the entire 100-page PDF at once → R150+ per run + hallucinations.  
This version splits pages, skips junk, costs ~R10–R30 per real project.

## Status
Phase 0 – looking for the first 20 South African quantity surveying firms for **free pilots this week**.

Free pilot → honest feedback → paid projects.

Built by a final-year Computer Science student at University of Johannesburg.
